# Build an app

Building an app using Cloud Native Buildpacks is as easy as `1`, `2`, `3`...

### 1. Select a builder

To [build][build] an app you must first decide which [builder][builder] you're going to use. A builder
includes the [buildpacks][buildpack] that will be used as well as the environment for building your
app.

When using `pack`, you can run `pack builder suggest` for a list of suggested builders.

```bash
pack builder suggest
```{{execute}}

For this guide we're actually going to use a sample builder, `cnbs/sample-builder:bionic`, which is not listed
as a suggested builder for good reason. It's a sample.

### 2. Build your app

Now that you've decided on what builder to use, we can build our app. For this example we'll use our [samples][samples]
repo for simplicity.

1. Check that the samples repo exists
```
ls samples
```{{execute}}

2. Build the app
```
pack build sample-app --path samples/apps/java-maven --builder cnbs/sample-builder:bionic
```{{execute}}

> **TIP:** If you don't want to keep specifying a builder every time you build, you can set it as your default
> builder by running `pack config default-builder <BUILDER>` for example `pack config default-builder cnbs/sample-builder:bionic`{{execute}}.

### 3. Run it

```
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 sample-app
```{{execute}}

**Congratulations!**

Now hit open the port `8080` of your host in your favorite browser and take a minute to enjoy the view.
