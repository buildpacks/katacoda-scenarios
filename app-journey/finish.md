## All done

Congratulations! You have successfully created your first app using buildpacks!

### Take your image to the skies

`pack` uses **buildpacks** to help you easily create OCI images that you can run just about anywhere. Try
deploying your new image to your favorite cloud!

> In case you need it, `pack build` has a handy flag called `--publish` that will build your image directly onto a Docker
> registry. You can learn more about `pack` features in the [documentation][pack-docs].
